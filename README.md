Responsive Web Design Project for FreeCodeCamp (2 of 5)<br>

Information about the project can be found here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/build-a-tribute-page-project/build-a-tribute-page<br>

The main outputs of this project are the index.html and styles.css files

I decided to create a tribute page for one of my dearest friends, Margie Olbinado, who is a scientist working in Switzerland. The tribute page contains a brief bio and a condensed career timeline.
